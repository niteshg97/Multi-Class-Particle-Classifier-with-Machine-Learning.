# Multi-Class-Particle-Classifier-with-Machine-Learning.
This project successfully demonstrates that machine learning can be used to classify subatomic particles with a very high degree of overall accuracy (up to 96.85%).  However, the most important conclusion is that overall accuracy is not the best metric for this research problem.
