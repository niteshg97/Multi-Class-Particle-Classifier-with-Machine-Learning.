# Multi-Class Particle Classifier

**A reproducible notebook project** that builds and compares multiple machine-learning models to classify subatomic particles (Pion, Proton, Kaon, Electron) using detector features such as momentum and velocity.

---

## Overview 🧭

This project demonstrates end-to-end model development for a physics classification problem using a real dataset (original CSV referenced in the notebook: `/content/drive/My Drive/pid-5M.csv`). The notebook:

Dataset Source:  
This large dataset is from Kaggle — [Particle Identification from Detector Responses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naharrison/particle-identification-from-detector-responses), a simulation of electron-proton inelastic scattering measured by a particle detector system.

* Loads and samples the data (50,000 rows from the full dataset)
* Performs exploratory data analysis (correlations, scatter plots)
* Trains five classical ML models and one neural network
* Evaluates models on a held-out test set (10,000 particles)
* Analyzes per-class performance, highlighting class imbalance and rare-particle detection

## Important Findings — Detailed 🔎

### 1️⃣ Accuracy-Only Comparison (The “Bake-Off”)

Random Forest slightly outperformed the Neural Network on overall accuracy (96.85% vs. 96.65%).  
However, deeper metrics reveal a critical imbalance-driven flaw.

### 2️⃣ The Class Imbalance Problem 🚨

| Particle | Precision | Recall | F1 | Support |
| :-------- | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| **Electron** | 0.89 | **0.28** | 0.42 | 29 |
| **Kaon** | 0.75 | **0.72** | 0.73 | 425 |
| **Pion** | 0.98 | 0.97 | 0.98 | 5669 |
| **Proton** | 0.98 | 0.99 | 0.98 | 3877 |

➡️ The Random Forest achieved high accuracy primarily due to strong performance on **Pions** and **Protons**, which together account for **95% of the dataset**.  
It struggled with rare particles — **Electrons** (28% recall) and **Kaons** (72% recall).

### 3️⃣ Feature Importance (Physics Alignment)

Feature importances show `beta` (velocity) and `p` (momentum) dominate — aligning with the physics principle that mass differentiates particles with the same momentum.

## 🏁 Final Conclusion & Key Findings

This project successfully demonstrated the application of multiple machine learning models for multi-class particle identification.

### Key Finding 1: Overall Accuracy is High, but Misleading

While the **Random Forest** appears to be the best model by accuracy, this metric hides the model’s failure on rare classes (Electrons and Kaons).

### Key Finding 2: The Neural Network Excels in Rare Particle Detection

| Particle (Support) | Random Forest (Recall) | Neural Network (Recall) | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electron** (29) | 0.28 | **0.38** | 🧠 **Neural Network** |
| **Kaon** (425) | 0.72 | **0.77** | 🧠 **Neural Network** |
| **Pion** (5669) | 0.97 | 0.97 | ⚖️ Tie |
| **Proton** (3877) | 0.99 | 0.99 | ⚖️ Tie |

✅ The Neural Network, despite slightly lower overall accuracy, delivers **superior recall** for rare particles — making it more scientifically valuable.

---

### 🔧 Final Recommendation

While **Random Forest** wins on paper, the **Neural Network** is **the more promising model** for this physics problem.  
Future research should focus on improving **Recall** for rare classes, not overall accuracy.

**Recommended next steps:**

1. **Feature Engineering** — create physics-inspired features (e.g., mass proxy from `p` and `β`).  
2. **Data Resampling** — apply **SMOTE** or other resampling methods to balance class representation.  
3. **Weighted Loss Optimization** — penalize misclassification of rare classes using class weights or focal loss in the NN.
